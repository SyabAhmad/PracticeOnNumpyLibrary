# NumPy is an open-source Python library for performing
# array computing (matrix operations). It can be used to
# perform a wide variety of mathematical operations on arrays
# and matrices. NumPy objects can be easily converted to other
# types of objects like the Pandas data frame and the tensorflow tensor.
#
# NumPy provides a large number of mathematical functions that
# can be performed on arrays and matrices. These functions include
# trigonometric, algebraic, and statistical operations. Some of the
# mathematical functions provided by NumPy are:
#
# - `add(): Adds two arrays element-wise.
# - `subtract(): Subtracts two arrays element-wise.
# - `multiply(): Multiplies two arrays element-wise.
# - `divide(): Divides two arrays element-wise.
# - `power(): Raises the elements of an array to a specified power.
# - `sqrt(): Computes the square root of each element in an array.
# - `exp(): Computes the exponential of each element in an array.
# - `log(): Computes the natural logarithm of each element in an array.
# - `sin(): Computes the sine of each element in an array.
# - `cos(): Computes the cosine of each element in an array.
# - `tan(): Computes the tangent of each element in an array.
# - `arcsin(): Computes the inverse sine of each element in an array.
# - `arccos(): Computes the inverse cosine of each element in an array.
# - `arctan(): Computes the inverse tangent of each element in an array.
# - `dot(): Computes the dot product of two arrays.
